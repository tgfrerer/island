Here is what we need to do to allocate memory using the vma memory allocator:

VK_NV_ray_tracing is a custom extension from Nvidia, not part of core Vulkan API and as such it's not directly supported by VMA. To use VMA to allocate memory for acceleration structure, use following steps:

    Call vkCreateAccelerationStructureKHR, get your VkAccelerationStructureKHR accelStruct.
    Call vkGetAccelerationStructureMemoryRequirementsNV, get VkMemoryRequirements2KHR memReq.
    Fill VmaAllocationCreateInfo allocCreateInfo: set memoryTypeBits = memReq.memoryTypeBits, set rest of fields to zero.
    Call vmaAllocateMemory - pass your memReq.memoryRequirements along with allocCreateInfo, get your VmaAllocation alloc and VmaAllocationInfo allocInfo.
    Call vkBindAccelerationStructureMemoryNV to bind your accelStruct to allocInfo.deviceMemory, allocInfo.offset.

This is all assuming that you do all your memory allocation, mapping, and binding on one thread. If you use multiple threads, then please note that a memory for different acceleration structures or regular buffers and images may come from a single device memory block. Binding is synchronized internally when using functions like vmaCreateBuffer or vmaBindBufferMemory, but not when you call Vulkan function directly, like vkBindAccelerationStructureMemoryNV. In that case you need to either protect any allocation/mapping/binding with a mutex on your own, or use separate custom VmaPool for your resources used on one thread, or create each such allocation as VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.

Don't forget to destroy both acceleration structure and the allocation when no longer needed, using functions vkDestroyAccelerationStructureKHR, vmaFreeMemory respectively.

maybe we can create our pipelines in a similar way as to how we create the graphics pipelines:

first specify all (symbolic) resources and how they interconnect so that we can fingerprint
then, in the backend, materialize symbolic resources and create an actual pipeline and associate
it with the fingerprint.

if things change in the symbolic front level, update in the backend accordingly.

What makes the gestalt for a rtx pipeline?

+ pipelinelayout made out of descriptorSets[]
+ shaderstages[]
